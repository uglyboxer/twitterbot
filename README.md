# Twitter Bot

## A baseline gateway for a Twitterbot.  What it has to say, will come shortly.

Instructions for obtaining keys and tokens, and the basic Python for accessing the Twitter API can be found [here](http://www.dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/).


The rest of this document will fill out as I decide what it will actually do.

Helper functions _filter_harsh and clean_tweet, are very specific use cases and could be abstracted out.

```python
Bot._filter_harsh(tweet, tag)
```
Is specifically for stripping the tags, only from the end a tweet, and verifying the given parameter tag is in that list.

```python
Bot.clean_tweet(tweet, tag)
```
Is specifically for pulling out the # character, usernames, and urls.

TODO.  Make each of those a separate cleaning function.
TODO.  Remove RT.  Filter those tweets too?
TODO.  Tests.
TODO.  Use Tweepy helpers to wait for rate limits
